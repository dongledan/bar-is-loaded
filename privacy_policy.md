# Privacy Policy
#### Last updated [April 4, 2019]

I, Danny Li, respects the privacy of our users (“user” or “you”). This Privacy Policy explains how I collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our mobile application (Bar is Loaded). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS THE APPLICATION.

I reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. I will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted the changes in any revised Privacy Policy by your continued use of the Application after the date such revised Privacy Policy is posted.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the third-party online/mobile store from which you install the Application or make payments, including any in-game virtual items, which may also collect and use data about you. We are not responsible for any of the data collected by any such third party.

This Privacy Policy was created using Termly’s Privacy Policy Generator.

## COLLECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION
I may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information I may collect via the Application depends on the content and materials you use, and includes:

### Personal Data
Rest easy, I do not collect data, period. I physically can’t, there is no where to store it. I do not even have a database to store it. All saved changes are stored locally in your device and deleted if you, the user, choose to delete the app.

There is no account sign up nor do we ask for any personal information. The only data that is stored from the application is whether you want the inputs to be in KG or LB.

### Mobile Device Access
I may request access or permission to certain features from your mobile device, including your mobile device’s [data for third party links to websites]. If you wish to change my access or permissions, you may do so in your device’s settings.

### THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES
Bar is Loaded may contain links to third-party websites and applications of interest, including advertisements and external services, that are not affiliated with us. Once you have used these links to leave the Application, any information you provide to these third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy, and I cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of your information. Before visiting and providing any information to any third-party websites, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website, and should take those steps necessary to, in your discretion, protect the privacy of your information. I am not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other sites, services or applications that may be linked to or from the Application.

### SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION
Although no personal information is provided, I still make sure any data is secure to the greatest extent possible. Do keep in mind that any transmission of data over the internet or any other method of electronic usage is not 100% secure and thus cannot be guaranteed.

### POLICY FOR CHILDREN
I do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If you become aware of any data I have collected from children under age 13, please contact us using the contact information provided below.
