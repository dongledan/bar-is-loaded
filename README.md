# Bar is Loaded
## Mission
I created this app during my time in quarantine in 2020. I first got the idea for this app after competing in a USAPL powerlifting meet. It was my second meet but first in this federation. Up to the meet, I was training with pound plates and had gotten used to quick maths for loading the bar. However, USAPL uses calibrated KG plates-- on the platform and in the warmup room (depending on venue). Although it's just simple division by 2.2046 to find lb to kg, it was still very annoying. There are a lot of things going on that day and my goal was to have an app to do plate loading calculations with a simple graphic that's easy to follow.

## Privacy Policy
I don't store your data, period. There is no external database, how many plates you have or how much your barbell weighs is your business.

## FAQ
#### Who is Henry?
He's a buddy that I just wanted to mess with.

#### How are the weights calculated?
Based on the input weight, it is rounded down to the smallest plate in your inventory (ex. 1.25kg would be rounded to the nearest 2.5kg since 1.25 + 1.25 plates on each end is 2.5 quick maths). I also rounded down because I think it's better to be conservative than to overshoot.

#### Who is this app for?
Any swole people out there who doesn't want to do math, it's leg day-- not brain day. Personally for me, it's when I go to a gym with kg plates or at a meet that uses kg plates. I usually train with lb plates and it'll be one less thing to worry about warming up.
