## Mission
I built Bar Is Loaded in quarantine (2020) after competing in a USAPL powerlifting meet. Training with lb plates was easy, but meet day meant switching to kg‚Äîcue the mental math headache. My goal? A simple, visual app to handle plate loading so you can focus on lifting, not math.

## Privacy Policy
I don't store your data, period. There is no external database, how many plates you have or how much your barbell weighs is your business.

## FAQ
#### How do I switch between KG and LB?
* Settings tab (last tab).

#### How are weights calculated?
* Rounded down to the smallest plate in your inventory. (Ex: 1.25kg ‚Üí 2.5kg because 1.25+1.25 = 2.5. Quick maths.)

#### How do I customize my inventory & barbells?
* Header links let you adjust plates, collars, and barbell weights. Add, edit, and swap with ease.

#### What‚Äôs the percent value?
* Adjusts how much of a weight is calculated (ex: 80% for warm-ups). Reset to 100% for normal use.

#### Who is this app for?
* Anyone who hates math on leg day. Great for lifters who train in lb but compete in kg.
